##Right of withdrawal

The right of withdrawal will be exercised in accordance with the modalities set out in the Consumer Code. The Buyer is informed that in accordance with article VI.53. of the Code of Economic Law, the right of withdrawal cannot be exercised for Products that are likely to deteriorate or expire quickly. 

Apart from this type of Products, the Buyer has a period of 14 (fourteen) working days, from the date of purchase of the Products, to withdraw without having to justify the reasons or pay penalties, except for the cost of return which remains at his expense and which he must pay. 

The Buyer who wishes to exercise his/her right of retraction must send MySesame at the contact details provided hereafter, before the expiry of the above deadline, the retraction form appended to these general terms and conditions duly completed, or a statement clearly expressing his/her wish to retract and including his/her order number. 

The Products must imperatively be returned to MySesame in their original packaging, without undue delay and at the latest within 14 (fourteen) calendar days following the communication, by the Buyer, of his wish to retract. They must be accompanied by a copy of the corresponding purchase invoice. The Buyer is deemed liable in the event of deterioration of the Products when they are returned to MySesame.

The Buyer shall be reimbursed as soon as possible and at the latest within 14 (fourteen) days from the date of effective receipt by MySesame of the withdrawal request for the full amount paid for his/her order, less any return costs, which remain at the Buyer's expense. However, MySesame reserves the right to defer this reimbursement until the Products have been effectively recovered.

##Legal guarantees

The Buyer is expressly informed that the Products, by their nature, deteriorate rapidly.

He acknowledges therefore that all Products must be kept in a cool place without humidity and consumed within the period indicated on the packaging.

However, MySesame reminds that the Buyer benefits from the legal guarantees of non-conformity as well as hidden defects of the item sold, including defects of conformity resulting from the packaging of the Products purchased.

If the Buyer finds that the Product purchased has a defect, a lack of conformity or is damaged, he must inform MySesame thereof at the contact details provided hereafter, indicating the nature of the defect, non-conformity or damage found and sending him any useful proof, in particular in the form of photograph(s).

MySesame will organize the return procedure and will inform the Buyer by any useful means. MySesame will bear the costs of this return.

Products must be returned to MySesame in their original packaging. They must be accompanied by a copy of the corresponding purchase invoice.

Returns of Products that do not comply with the terms and conditions described above will not be taken into account. MySesame will carry out the necessary checks and will propose to the Buyer the replacement of the Product as far as possible. If the replacement of the Product is impossible, MySesame will reimburse the Buyer the full price paid for the Product as well as the corresponding delivery costs, by any useful means, as soon as possible and at the latest within 14 (fourteen) days following the date on which MySesame has informed the Buyer that it is impossible to replace the Product.
