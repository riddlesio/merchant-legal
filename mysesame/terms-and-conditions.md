The purpose of these GT&C is to define the rights and obligations of the Parties in connection with the sale of Products by MySesame to the Buyer. Any purchase of Products implies the Buyer's unreserved acceptance and full and complete adherence to these GT&C. The applicable version of the general terms and conditions is the one that can be consulted online on the MySesame Site on the date of the Buyer's order, a copy of which is sent to the Buyer with the confirmation of his registration.

##Article 2: Creating an account

To access our services, the Buyer can register as a user via our mobile phone application to access the Equipment and make payments. Registration is free. If you are under 18 years of age, a parent or legal guardian is required for registration. Alternatively, the non-registered Buyer may access the Equipment by using his/her credit card to purchase drinks, snacks and fresh meals. To make a purchase of Products via the application, the Buyer must first create and activate his account on the application using his professional email address as login. He will then have to deposit a valid means of payment and validate the creation of his account.

Registration automatically leads to the opening of an account in the Buyer's name (hereinafter: the " Account"), giving him access to a personal space (hereinafter: the " PersonalSpace ") that allows him to manage his purchases and to have access to his invoices.

The Buyer guarantees that all the information he or she provides in the registration form is accurate, sincere, up to date and not misleading.

The Buyer is informed and accepts that the information entered for the purpose of creating or updating his or her Account is proof of his or her identity. The information entered by the Buyer is committed as soon as it is validated.

The Buyer agrees to use his Account personally and not to allow any third party to use it in his place or on his behalf, unless he bears full responsibility for it.

The Buyer is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of his Account and password, restrictions on access to his laptop and other equipment.

The Buyer is responsible for all activities that are conducted from his account or with his password. The Buyer may delete his account at any time. The Buyer will then no longer be able to use our services via the application.

In the event of a breach of these GT&C and/or the legal or regulatory provisions in force, MySesame reserves the right to refuse access to the account of the Buyer concerned or to close it.

##Article 3: Consultation of operations

The last purchases made as well as the invoice history can be viewed on the buyer's personal account via the application.

##Article 4: Purchase of Products and Conditions of Use of the Equipment

####4.1 Assortment

Our offer is always limited to the stock available in the relevant Equipment. MySesame is not obliged to supply the Buyer with a specific Product if the stock of that Product in the relevant Equipment is exhausted. In addition, our offer is subject to the technical functionality of the Equipment.

MySesame has implemented a strict process regarding the consumption dates of each Product. All expired Products will be subject to withdrawal by MySesame. Consequently, the Buyer shall refrain from withdrawing and consuming expired Products.

####4.2 Purchase of Products

By withdrawing one or more Products from an Equipment, a valid contract of sale between MySesame and the Buyer is entered into as a result of the Buyer's acceptance of our offer. After identification and opening of the Equipment, the Buyer can take the desired products located in the Equipment in the desired quantity, as long as the total amount of products chosen does not surpass the preauthorization amount displayed on the Equipment. As soon as the Equipment is closed, the sale contract is concluded and the purchase process is completed. The machine can now access the Buyer's credit card information. Once the purchase process is complete, the purchase price is automatically debited from the Purchaser's credit card. The Purchaser must ensure that his/her credit card is covered when using our services. We will request a refund of any chargeback fees, if applicable.

####4.3 Conditions of use of the Equipment

The Buyer undertakes to use the Equipment in a normally prudent, diligent and careful manner and in accordance with the conditions of use recommended by MySesame in the present user guide.

The Buyer shall in particular refrain from damaging the Equipment, from using the Equipment in a way that could affect the safety and quality of the Products (open Equipment, open Products inside the Equipment, ...). The Purchaser shall refrain from using the Equipment for purposes other than those for which it is intended and in particular to store Products.

In the event that the Buyer notes that the rules for use of the Equipment have not been complied with and could affect the safety and quality of the Products, he undertakes to immediately inform MySesame thereof by sending an e-mail to the following e-mail address: miam@mysesame.be under the conditions defined in article 13 of the GT&C, to enable MySesame to remedy the situation as quickly as possible.

##Article 5: Obligations of the Buyers

Buyers are solely responsible for the choice and use they make of the Products. It is their responsibility to check the suitability of the Products for their specific needs and constraints prior to purchasing the said Products.
On the other hand, they may under no circumstances resell the Products purchased from the Equipment.
Purchasers must also take the necessary measures to safeguard by their own means the information in their Personal Space that they deem necessary.

##Article 6: Product Information

Prior to any purchase and in application notably of the provisions of article VI.2. of the Belgian Code of Economic Law, the Buyer may take note of the characteristics of each Product that he wishes to purchase directly on the application.

MySesame will ensure that the photographs of the Products presented on the MySesame application or on the screen of the Equipment are as faithful as possible to the Products themselves.
However, the photographs have only an illustrative purpose without having any contractual value. As a result of the foregoing, MySesame may not be held liable and no claim may be made on the basis of any discrepancies between the photographs presented on the MySesame Site or the Equipment and the Products for sale.

For all non-standardised farm products, in particular fish, meat, cold meats and cheese, their weight may vary within a range of + or - 10% in relation to the weight indicated in the product description. If the weight of the product is more or less than 10% of the weight indicated in the product description, the excess or insufficient weight shall not give rise to any proportional increase or decrease in the price. Moreover, this difference in weight may not be the subject of a claim on the part of the customer for non-conformity of the product. Consequently, MySesame shall not be held liable in the event of errors, inaccuracies or omissions relating to information on the Products sold.

The Products comply with all Belgian standards, legal provisions and regulations relating to health, safety and consumer protection.

The safety and quality of the Products are guaranteed by compliance with the rules governing transport and storage of the Products until they are marketed to the Buyer.

Nevertheless, in the event that the Buyer finds that the safety or quality standards are not respected, he/she undertakes to inform MySesame immediately by sending an e-mail to the following e-mail address: miam@mysesame.be under the conditions defined in article 13 of the GT&C, to enable the latter to remedy the situation as quickly as possible.

The Products are offered for sale within the limits of available stocks, subject to the possibility of ordering them if necessary. However, MySesame reserves the right to interrupt the marketing of certain Products at any time and without notice.

##Article 7: Prices

The applicable prices of the Products are displayed on the Application and directly on the Equipment.

They are indicated in euros, all taxes included (Belgian VAT and other applicable taxes).

MySesame reserves the right to modify the prices of the Products at any time subject to applying the prices indicated on the Products at the time of purchase. MySesame also reserves the right, at its own discretion and according to terms and conditions of which it shall be the sole judge, to propose promotional offers or price reductions.

##Article 8: Invoicing

The Purchase of Products by the Buyer shall give rise to the establishment of an invoice by MySesame. This invoice will show the amount of the totality of the operations for the invoicing period as well as the amount due.

This invoice can be consulted from the Buyer's personal space on the My Account application.

It may be issued by the Buyer electronically from the My Account application, which the Buyer already accepts.

##Article 9: Right of withdrawal

The right of withdrawal will be exercised in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Consumer Code. The Buyer is informed that in accordance with article VI.53. of the Code of Economic Law, the right of withdrawal cannot be exercised for Products that are likely to deteriorate or expire quickly.

Apart from this type of Products, the Buyer has a period of 14 (fourteen) working days, from the date of purchase of the Products, to withdraw without having to justify the reasons or pay penalties, except for the cost of return which remains at his expense and which he must pay.

The Buyer who wishes to exercise his/her right of retraction must send MySesame at the contact details mentioned in article 13 hereof, before the expiry of the above deadline, the retraction form appended to these general terms and conditions duly completed, or a statement clearly expressing his/her wish to retract and including his/her order number.

The Products must imperatively be returned to MySesame in their original packaging, without undue delay and at the latest within 14 (fourteen) calendar days following the communication, by the Buyer, of his wish to retract. They must be accompanied by a copy of the corresponding purchase invoice. The Buyer is deemed liable in the event of deterioration of the Products when they are returned to MySesame.

The Buyer shall be reimbursed as soon as possible and at the latest within 14 (fourteen) days from the date of effective receipt by MySesame of the withdrawal request for the full amount paid for his/her order, less any return costs, which remain at the Buyer's expense. However, MySesame reserves the right to defer this reimbursement until the Products have been effectively recovered.

##Article 10: Legal guarantees

The Buyer is expressly informed that the Products, by their nature, deteriorate rapidly.

He acknowledges therefore that all Products must be kept in a cool place without humidity and consumed within the period indicated on the packaging.

However, MySesame reminds that the Buyer benefits from the legal guarantees of non-conformity as well as hidden defects of the item sold, including defects of conformity resulting from the packaging of the Products purchased.

If the Buyer finds that the Product purchased has a defect, a lack of conformity or is damaged, he must inform MySesame thereof at the contact details mentioned in article 13 hereof, indicating the nature of the defect, non-conformity or damage found and sending him any useful proof, in particular in the form of photograph(s).

MySesame will organize the return procedure and will inform the Buyer by any useful means. MySesame will bear the costs of this return.

Products must be returned to MySesame in their original packaging. They must be accompanied by a copy of the corresponding purchase invoice.

Returns of Products that do not comply with the terms and conditions described above will not be taken into account. MySesame will carry out the necessary checks and will propose to the Buyer the replacement of the Product as far as possible. If the replacement of the Product is impossible, MySesame will reimburse the Buyer the full price paid for the Product as well as the corresponding delivery costs, by any useful means, as soon as possible and at the latest within 14 (fourteen) days following the date on which MySesame has informed the Buyer that it is impossible to replace the Product.

##Article 11: Personal Data

MySesame has a personal data protection policy, the characteristics of which are explained in the document entitled "Privacy Charter", of which the Buyer is expressly invited to take cognizance. MySesame uses the e-mail address provided by the Buyer during the registration procedure to inform him/her by e-mail of the current menus. In addition, we send our newsletter in this way. If you no longer wish to receive such information by e-mail, the use of your e-mail contact data for these purposes can be revoked at any time with effect for the future at no cost. You can send us your revocation by e-mail to miam@mysesame.be.

##Article 12: Reclamation

Any questions or claims regarding the Products must be made within forty-eight (48) hours of the removal of the Products from the Equipment, by e-mail, to the address indicated below. After this period, no questions or complaints will be taken into account.

Any question or claim by the Buyer must be made by registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt to the following address: miam@mysesame.be or to 160 Boite 16 avenue Jules Bordet - 1140 Brussels.

##Article 13: Liability

MySesame is responsible for any direct damage related to the consumption of the Products and foreseeable at the time of the selection of the Products by the Buyer. MySesame undertakes to comply with the regulations applicable to foodstuffs and in terms of food labelling.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, MySesame shall not be held liable in case of force majeure. Any irresistible, unforeseeable facts or circumstances beyond the control of the Parties and which cannot be prevented by the latter, despite all reasonably possible efforts, shall be considered as force majeure. Explicitly, are considered as force majeure or fortuitous events, in addition to those usually retained by the jurisprudence of the Belgian courts and tribunals: the blocking of means of transport or supplies, earthquakes, fires, storms, floods, lightning, stoppage of telecommunications networks, difficulties specific to telecommunications networks external to the customers as well as any legal or regulatory obligation or public order imposed by the competent authorities and which would have the effect of substantially modifying the present general conditions.

MySesame's liability is also excluded in the event of direct or indirect damage, affecting goods or persons, suffered by the Buyer or a third party, and resulting from the following cases:

- Negligence or fault committed by the Buyer or a third party;
- Natural expiry of the Products;
- Any use in conditions that are manifestly non-compliant for the use of the Products.

The Products, which have not undergone any treatment, must be kept in a dry and cool place, away from light, and must be consumed within one hour of their removal from the Equipment by the Purchaser. Storage conditions must be strictly respected by the Buyer. Failing this, MySesame cannot be held responsible for any deterioration of the products. MySesame's liability is expressly excluded for damage resulting in particular from negligence, lack of maintenance, lack of surveillance, inappropriate storage, intervention by a third party on the Products, etc.

MySesame may not be held liable in the event of a delay due to a stock shortage or in the event of minor differences between the photographs of the Products and/or the information presenting the Product indicated on the Sesame Site, on the Equipment or on promotional offers, and the Products offered for sale within the Equipment. The limitation of liability referred to above shall not apply in the event of fraud or gross negligence on the part of MySesame, in the event of personal injury or liability due to defective products, in the event of eviction and in the event of non-compliance.

Finally, MySesame does not provide the Buyer with any guarantee as to the adaptation of the Products to its needs, expectations or constraints.

##Article 14: Amendments

MySesame reserves the right to modify the present general terms and conditions of sale at any time. It must publish the new general terms and conditions of sale on its MySesame Site or by e-mail at least fifteen (15) days before they come into force. In this case, the applicable conditions shall be those in force on the date of the Buyer's order.

##Article 15: Entirety

MySesame reserves the right to modify the present general terms and conditions of sale at any time, provided that it publishes the new general terms and conditions of sale on its MySesame Site or by e-mail at least fifteen (15) days before they come into force. In this case, the applicable conditions will be those in force on the date of the Buyer's order. These GT&C constitute the entire agreement of the Parties. It cancels and replaces all previous contracts and agreements between the Parties having the same object.

The fact that one of the Parties tolerates a situation does not have the effect of granting the other Party and/or waiving the rights in question.

The Parties agree that if one of the stipulations of the GT&C is deemed null and void or inapplicable, the other stipulations shall remain in full force and effect.

##Article 16: Language

In the event of a translation of these general terms and conditions into one or more languages, the language of interpretation shall be the French language in the event of a contradiction or dispute as to the meaning of a term or provision.

##Article 17: Applicable law - Settlement of disputes

The Buyer may address his complaints by mail to MySesame, stating the difficulties and/or shortcomings observed, to the following address: miam@mysesame.be or to 160 Boite 16 avenue Jules Bordet - 1140 Brussels.

In the event of a reply deemed unsatisfactory by the Buyer or in the absence of a reply within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the complaint by MySesame, the Buyer has the right to have recourse free of charge to a consumer mediator with a view to the amicable resolution of any dispute relating to the execution of the present terms and conditions that may arise between the Buyer and MySesame under the conditions set out in Title 3 of the French Code of Economic Law.
