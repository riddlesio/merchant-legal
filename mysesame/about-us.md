MySesame combines a home-like fridge experience with that of a traditional vending machine, by making fresh food available to our customers round the clock.

This new concept makes use of commercial fridges from third party suppliers. These fridges include an electronic lock which can be opened by an App or a range of contactless payment methods (debit and credit cards). The consumers need a personal account to have access to the App and to be able to identify and open the fridge.

The consumers provide their (credit card) payment details via the App. To process the products taken from the Fridge the customer is pre-authorized before the fridge opens and is charged when the fridge is closed (payment settlement). The order information (what products are taken out of the fridge) is registered by using RFID technology. Payment details like bank card data are secured and managed by global international company Adyen which works and provides services to large international companies such as UBER, Booking.com, Ebay, Spotify and others.

To put it simply, consumers pay us for the products from our fridge. The food we supply is prepared fresh and delivered straight to the fridge without any delays.
