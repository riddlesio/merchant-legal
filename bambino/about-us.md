The Intelligent Fridges work like traditional vending machines, but make it possible to supply fresh foods e.g. fruit, salads, dairy products and give a more home-like experience to the consumers.

This new concept makes use of commercial fridges from third party suppliers which include an electronic lock which can be opened by an App. The consumers need a personal Account to have access to the App and to be able to identify and open the Fridge.

The consumers provide their (credit card) payment details via the App. For processing the products taken from the Fridge the customer is pre-authorized before the Fridge opens and will be charged when the Fridge is closed (payment settlement). The order information (what products are taken of the Fridge) is registered by using RFID technology. Your payment details like your bank card data are secure and managed by global international company Adyen which works and provides services to large international companies such as UBER, Booking.com, Ebay, Spotify and others.

To put it simply, consumers pay us for the products from our Fridge. The food we supply is prepared fresh and delivered straight to the fridge without any delays.
