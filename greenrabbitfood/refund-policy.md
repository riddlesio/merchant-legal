We provide our products immediately at purchase, offered via our Fridges.

As Green Rabbit sells consumable products, we are unfortunately unable to accept any refunds unless the product is damaged upon receipt. In such case or in the exceptional situation that you are charged for products that were not taken from our Fridge, please contact us via our email: info@greenrabbitfood.de. You can find our other contact information on the Contact page.
