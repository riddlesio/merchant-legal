Green Rabbit specialises in healthy and balanced nutrition for everyday life. We cook and deliver freshly prepared meals to your home or office.

The fresh dishes are stored in smart fridges. Customers can open the smart fridges via our app or RFID-enabled bank cards and access the products at any time. After closing the door, the smart fridges automatically recognize the withdrawals and calculate the purchase price. The respective amount is then deducted directly form the customer's bank account.

The use of our App requires a personal and pre-authorized Green Rabbit account. Therefore, customers must provide their contact data and choose a payment method. The payments are executed through Adyen, a large and experienced payment provider that also serves established international companies such as UBER, Booking.com, Ebay or Spotify. Adyen guarantees a safe and faultless payment procedure.
