We provide our products immediately at purchase, offered via our Fridges in Lithuania.

As OSAMA sells consumable products, we are unfortunately unable to accept any refunds unless the product is damaged upon receipt.

In such case or in the exceptional situation that you are charged for products not taken from our Fridge, please contact us. You can find our contact information on our Contact page.
