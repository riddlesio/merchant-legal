##How it works

Our Smart Fridges are operated by means of a mobile application, that can be downloaded from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. You are asked to create a user account and provide payment details once. The app contains a QR scanner which is used to unlock the Smart Fridge. Once unlocked you can just take out any products you want. Your selection is settled automatically once you close the fridge door. The app will list your purchases and receipts.
