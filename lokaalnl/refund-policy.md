We provide our products immediately at purchase via our Fridge. As we sell consumable food products, we are unable to accept any refunds, unless the product is damaged or spoiled upon receipt. In case you are wrongly charged for products you have not taken from the Fridge, please contact us. You can find our contact information on our contact page.
