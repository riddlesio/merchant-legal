FOOZO is a food solution provider for people at work or at home. We deliver fresh food from different cuisines and selected restaurants to our clients. The meals are either delivered directly to customers after purchasing them via our web shop foozo.lu or supplied stationarily where the clients are, via intelligent fridges.

The intelligent fridges make it possible to supply freshly made meals, fruits, salads, dairy products and provides a home-like experience to the users.

This new concept makes use of intelligent fridges featuring an electronic lock which can be opened either by an App or directly via a valid credit card, via a payment terminal connected to the fridge.

The users provide their (credit card) payment details via the App or apply directly their credit card on the payment terminal without providing any personal data in the App.

For processing the products taken from the Fridge the user is pre-authorized before the Fridge opens and will be charged when the Fridge is closed (payment settlement). The order information (which products are taken of the Fridge) is registered by using RFID technology.

The userâ€™s payment details like its bank card data are secure and managed by global international company Adyen with excellent market reputation, providing services to large international companies such as UBER, Booking.com, Ebay, Spotify and others.
