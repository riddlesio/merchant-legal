IMPORTANT: We, FOOZO, are managing commercial fridges ("Fridges") containing fresh and healthy food, drinks, snacks and other products supplied by us ("Products"). The technological solutions used in the Fridges make it possible for us to record and process which Products you purchase from us. This makes it easier for us to stock the Fridges properly and to know our consumersâ€™ needs. Payments occur through our FOOZO Fridges App ("App"), a mobile app that you must install on a mobile device, or through a payment terminal ("Payment Terminal") that is built onto the Fridges. These Terms and Conditions apply on all your interactions with the Fridges and your use of the App and/or Payment Terminal.

##1. Applicability of these Terms and Conditions

*1.1* These Terms and Conditions apply to all purchases you make through our Fridges, whether you pay through the App or through a Payment Terminal.

*1.2* These Terms and Conditions also apply when you download and install the App on your mobile device, whether you purchase Products from our Fridges or not. You will be asked to accept these Terms and Conditions before you create a user account ("Account"). These Terms and Conditions apply to your use of the App, until you decide to cancel your use of the App.

##2. Prices and payment

*2.1* As with any retail experience, you are not allowed to take Products from our Fridges without paying for them. Payment occurs immediately upon purchase. We offer various electronic payment methods, such as credit card or other (local) payment methods, to facilitate the purchase of Products from the Fridges. We reserve the right to add or remove payment methods without previous notice to you.

*2.2* Prices and currency charged for Products may vary depending on your location and may change from time to time. The prices of our Products include applicable sales tax.

*2.3* Errors and mistakes in the prices of our Products, for example when incorrect prices are shown in the App, on the display of the Fridges or on our website, do not bind us.

*2.4* If you have given your consent for processing payment details in the App or make use of a Payment Terminal, you authorize FOOZO to charge your bank account, credit card or any account relating to any other payment method.

*2.5* Your payment method may be preauthorized before making the actual purchase. If your payment method is declined, the Fridge may not open. We are not responsible if your payment method is declined for any reason.

##3. Refund and Cancellation Policy

*3.1* We deliver our Products immediately at purchase through our Fridges. Our Products are meant to be consumed immediately. After you have taken Products from the Fridge, you cannot return the Products or cancel your purchase. We do not offer any refunds if you are, for whatever reason, not satisfied with the Products you have purchased.

*3.2* We prepare our Products with the utmost care for quality and food safety. If you, however, happen to have purchased any Products that are not up to our high standards and something is off, please contact us at [hello@foozo.lu](mailto:hello@foozo.lu) as soon as possible and we will look for a suitable solution. If possible, please take pictures of the Products, so we can learn what went wrong.
