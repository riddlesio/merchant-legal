The Lunchery is a catering company based in Zug, Switzerland. Since its creation in 2019, the two founders, Jaap and Nicki Roukens have realized an unparalleled lunch delivery service for employees in offices and at home. Their vast experience in the field allowed The Lunchery to quickly differentiate itself from other delivery services through fresh, local, and delicious products as well as its sustainable and waste free operations. By offering a restaurant-like experience at the office desk or at home, employees avoid long waiting times, unhealthy food, and over-priced meals.

With The Lunchery intelligent fridges, companies can confidently offer their employees a delicious selection of breakfast and lunch meals as well as high quality snacks and drinks. All items in the fridge are served on beautiful porcelain, in biodegradable packaging or in re-usable glass bottles.

##Our goal:

- Offering companies and their employees a delicious culinary experience in the office
- Delivering on our promise of fresh, local, and delicious products daily
- Focusing on sustainable operations

How do you do it? With the Lunchery intelligent fridges.

##How it works?:

This intelligent fridge, unlike regular vending machines, allows the customers to choose from a variety of ready to eat meals, salads, bowls, snacks, and drinks with a user-friendly system. The number of products offered allows for a good selection throughout the entire day.

To enjoy the products, the user must create an account on the “The Lunchery” application, provide payment details which will enable customer identification. Alternatively, customers can present a credit/debit card directly to the payment terminal on the fridge and consume products without an account.

All payment details, like credit card data, is secured and managed by the international company Adyen.

Products are invoiced once the fridge door is closed through an identification technology located in the fridge. This way the consumer can benefit from quality products at the workplace!
